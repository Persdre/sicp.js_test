  Simulation is useful not only for verifying the correctness of a
  proposed machine design but also for measuring the machine<APOS/>s
  performance.  For example, we can install in our simulation program a
  <QUOTE>meter</QUOTE> that measures the number of stack operations used in a
  computation.  To do this, we modify our simulated stack to keep track
  of the number of times registers are saved on the stack and the
  maximum depth reached by the stack, and add a message to the stack<APOS/>s
  interface that prints the statistics, as shown below.
  We also add an operation to the basic machine model to print the
  stack statistics, by initializing <SCHEMEINLINE>the-ops</SCHEMEINLINE> in <SCHEMEINLINE>make-new-machine</SCHEMEINLINE> to
  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>

            (lambda () (stack 'initialize)))
      (list 'print-stack-statistics

      <EXERCISE>
  <!--  \indcode{factorial}[stack usage, register machine] -->
  Measure the number of pushes and the maximum stack depth required to
  compute <LATEXINLINE>$n!$</LATEXINLINE> for various small values of <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE> using the factorial
  machine shown in Figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:fact-machine"/>.  From your data
  determine formulas in terms of <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE> for the total number of push
  operations and the maximum stack depth used in computing <LATEXINLINE>$n!$</LATEXINLINE> for any
  <LATEXINLINE>$n &gt; 1$</LATEXINLINE>. Note that each of these is a linear function of <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE> and is
  thus determined by two constants.  In order to get the statistics
  printed, you will have to augment the factorial machine with instructions to
  initialize the stack and print the statistics.
  You may want to also modify the
  machine so that it repeatedly reads a value for <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE>, computes the
  factorial, and prints the result (as we did for the GCD machine in
  figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:gcd-with-io"/>), so that you will not have to repeatedly
  invoke <SCHEMEINLINE>get-register-contents</SCHEMEINLINE>, <SCHEMEINLINE>set-register-contents!</SCHEMEINLINE>, and
  <SCHEMEINLINE>start</SCHEMEINLINE>.
  <LABEL NAME="ex:measure-fact"/>
      </EXERCISE>

      <EXERCISE>
  Add 
  <INDEX>instruction counting</INDEX>
  <EM>instruction counting</EM> to the register machine simulation.
  That is, have the machine model keep track of the number of
  instructions executed.  Extend the machine model<APOS/>s interface to accept
  a new message that prints the value of the instruction count and
  resets the count to zero.
  <LABEL NAME="ex:instruction-count"/>
      </EXERCISE>

      <EXERCISE>
  Augment the simulator to provide for 
  <INDEX>instruction tracing</INDEX>
  <INDEX>tracing<SUBINDEX>instruction execution</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  <EM>instruction tracing</EM>.
  That is, before each instruction is executed, the simulator should print
  the text of the instruction.  Make the machine model accept <SCHEMEINLINE>trace-on</SCHEMEINLINE> and
  <SCHEMEINLINE>trace-off</SCHEMEINLINE> messages to turn tracing on and off.
  <LABEL NAME="ex:reg-machine-instruction-trace"/>
      </EXERCISE>

      <EXERCISE>
  Extend the instruction tracing of
  exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:reg-machine-instruction-trace"/> so that before
  printing an instruction, the simulator prints any labels that
  immediately precede that instruction in the controller sequence.  Be
  careful to do this in a way that does not interfere with instruction
  counting (exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:instruction-count"/>).
  You will have to make the simulator retain the necessary label information.
      </EXERCISE>

      <EXERCISE>
  <INDEX>register(s)<SUBINDEX>tracing</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  <INDEX>tracing<SUBINDEX>register assignment</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  Modify the <SCHEMEINLINE>make-register</SCHEMEINLINE>
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  of
  section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:machine-model"/> so that registers can be traced.
  Registers should accept messages that turn tracing on and off.  When a
  register is traced, assigning a value to the register should print the
  name of the register, the old contents of the register, and the new
  contents being assigned.  Extend the interface to the machine model
  to permit you to turn tracing on and off for designated machine registers.
      </EXERCISE>

      <EXERCISE><LABEL NAME="ex:breakpoints"/>
  Alyssa P. Hacker wants a 
  <INDEX>breakpoint</INDEX>
  <EM>breakpoint</EM> feature in the simulator to
  help her debug her machine designs.  You have been hired to install
  this feature for her.  She wants to be able to specify a place in the
  controller sequence where the simulator will stop and allow her to
  examine the state of the machine.  You are to implement a
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>

  <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
    <SCHEME>
      (set-breakpoint ^machine^ ^label^ ^n^)
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  that sets a breakpoint just before the <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE>th instruction after the
  given label.  For example,

  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>
      (set-breakpoint gcd-machine 'test-b 4)
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  installs a breakpoint in <SCHEMEINLINE>gcd-machine</SCHEMEINLINE> just before the
  assignment to register <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE>.  When the simulator reaches the
  breakpoint it should print the label and the offset of the breakpoint
  and stop executing instructions.  Alyssa can then use <SCHEMEINLINE>get-register-contents</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>set-register-contents!</SCHEMEINLINE> to manipulate
  the state of the simulated machine.  She should then be able to
  continue execution by saying

  <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
    <SCHEME>
      (proceed-machine ^machine^)
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  She should also be able to remove a specific breakpoint by means of

  <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
    <SCHEME>
      (cancel-breakpoint ^machine^ ^label^ ^n^)
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  or to remove all breakpoints by means of

  <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
    <SCHEME>
      (cancel-all-breakpoints ^machine^)
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
