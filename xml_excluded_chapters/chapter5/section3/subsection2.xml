      <TEXT>
  The representation method outlined in
  section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:memory-as-vectors"/> solves the problem of implementing
  list structure, provided that we have an infinite amount of memory.
  With a real computer we will eventually run out of free space in which
  to construct new pairs.<FOOTNOTE>This may not be true eventually,
    because memories may get large enough so that it would be impossible
    to run out of free memory in the lifetime of the computer.  For
    example, there are about <LATEXINLINE>$3\times 10^{13}$</LATEXINLINE>, microseconds in a year, so
    if we were to <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cons</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> once per microsecond we would need about
    <LATEXINLINE>$10^{15}$</LATEXINLINE> cells of memory to build a machine that could operate for 30
    years without running out of memory.  That much memory seems absurdly
    large by today<APOS/>s standards, but it is not physically impossible.  On
    the other hand, processors are getting faster and a future computer
    may have large numbers of processors operating in parallel on a single
    memory, so it may be possible to use up memory much faster than we
    have postulated.</FOOTNOTE>
  However, most of the pairs generated in a typical
  computation are used only to hold intermediate results.  After these
  results are accessed, the pairs are no longer needed<EMDASH/>they are <EM>
    garbage</EM>.  For instance, the computation

  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>
      (accumulate + 0 (filter odd? (enumerate-interval 0 n)))
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  constructs two lists: the enumeration and the result of filtering
  the enumeration.  When the accumulation is complete, these lists are
  no longer needed, and the allocated memory can be reclaimed.  If we
  can arrange to collect all the garbage periodically, and if this turns
  out to recycle memory at about the same rate at which we construct new
  pairs, we will have preserved the illusion that there is an infinite
  amount of memory.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
  In order to recycle pairs, we must have a way to determine which
  allocated pairs are not needed (in the sense that their contents can
  no longer influence the future of the computation).  The method we
  shall examine for accomplishing this is known as <EM>garbage
    collection</EM>.  Garbage collection is based on the observation that, at
  any moment in a <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>Lisp</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> interpretation, the only objects that can
  affect the future of the computation are those that can be reached by
  some succession of <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> and <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> operations starting from
  the pointers that are currently in the machine registers.<FOOTNOTE>We
    assume here that the stack is represented as a list as described in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:memory-as-vectors"/>, so that items on the stack are
    accessible via the pointer in the stack register.</FOOTNOTE>  Any memory cell
  that is not so accessible may be recycled.

  There are many ways to perform garbage collection.  The method we
  shall examine here is called 
  <INDEX>stop-and-copy garbage collector|(</INDEX>
  <INDEX>garbage collector<SUBINDEX>stop-and-copy|(</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  <EM>stop-and-copy</EM>.  The basic idea is
  to divide memory into two halves: <QUOTE>working memory</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>free
    memory.</QUOTE>  When <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cons</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> constructs pairs, it allocates these in
  working memory.  When working memory is full, we perform garbage
  collection by locating all the useful pairs in working memory and
  copying these into consecutive locations in free memory.  (The useful
  pairs are located by tracing all the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> and <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> pointers,
  starting with the machine registers.)  Since we do not copy the
  garbage, there will presumably be additional free memory that we can
  use to allocate new pairs.  In addition, nothing in the working memory
  is needed, since all the useful pairs in it have been copied.  Thus,
  if we interchange the roles of working memory and free memory, we can
  continue processing; new pairs will be allocated in the new working
  memory (which was the old free memory).  When this is full, we can
  copy the useful pairs into the new free memory (which was the old
  working memory).<FOOTNOTE><P>This idea was invented and first implemented
      <INDEX>Minsky, Marvin Lee</INDEX>
      by Minsky, as part of the implementation of

      <INDEX>Baker, Henry G., Jr.</INDEX>
      Baker (1978) developed a
      <QUOTE>real-time</QUOTE> version of the method, which does not require the
      computation to stop during garbage collection.  Baker<APOS/>s idea was

      An alternative commonly used garbage-collection technique is the

      <INDEX>garbage collector<SUBINDEX>mark-sweep</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>
        mark-sweep</EM> method.  This consists of tracing all the structure
      accessible from the machine registers and marking each pair we reach.
      We then scan all of memory, and any location that is unmarked is
      <QUOTE>swept up</QUOTE> as garbage and made available for reuse.  A full

    <P>
      The Minsky-Fenichel-Yochelson algorithm is the dominant algorithm in
      use for large-memory systems because it examines only the useful part
      of memory.  This is in contrast to mark-sweep, in which the sweep
      phase must check all of memory.  A second advantage of stop-and-copy
      is that it is a 
      <INDEX>compacting garbage collector</INDEX>
      <INDEX>garbage collector<SUBINDEX>compacting</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>compacting</EM> garbage collector.  That is, at the
      end of the garbage-collection phase the useful data will have been
      moved to consecutive memory locations, with all garbage pairs
      compressed out.  This can be an extremely important performance
      consideration in machines with virtual memory, in which accesses to
      widely separated memory addresses may require extra paging
      operations.</P></FOOTNOTE>

      <TEXT>
  We now use our register-machine language to describe the stop-and-copy
  algorithm in more detail.  We will assume that there is a register
  called 
  <!-- \indcodeplus{root}{register}-->
  <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> that contains a pointer to a structure that
  eventually points at all accessible data.  This can be arranged by
  storing the contents of all the machine registers in a
  pre-allocated list pointed at by <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> just before starting
  garbage collection.<FOOTNOTE>This list of registers does not include
    the registers used by the storage-allocation system<EMDASH/><SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE>, <SCHEMEINLINE>the-cars</SCHEMEINLINE>, <SCHEMEINLINE>the-cdrs</SCHEMEINLINE>, and the other registers that will be
    introduced in this section.</FOOTNOTE> We also assume that, in addition to the
  current working memory, there is free memory available into which we
  can copy the useful data.  The current working memory consists of
  vectors whose base addresses are in 
  <!--  \indcode{the-cars}[register] -->
  <!--  \indcode{the-cdrs}[register] -->
  registers called <SCHEMEINLINE>the-cars</SCHEMEINLINE>
  and <SCHEMEINLINE>the-cdrs</SCHEMEINLINE>, and the free memory is in registers called 
  <!-- \indcodeplus{new-cars}{register}-->
  <!-- \indcodeplus{new-cdrs}{register}-->
  <SCHEMEINLINE>new-cars</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>new-cdrs</SCHEMEINLINE>.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
  Garbage collection is triggered when we exhaust the free cells in the
  current working memory, that is, when a <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cons</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> operation attempts
  to increment the <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer beyond the end of the memory
  vector.  When the garbage-collection process is complete, the <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer will point into the new memory, all objects accessible
  from the <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> will have been moved to the new memory, and the
  <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer will indicate the next place in the new memory
  where a new pair can be allocated.  In addition, the roles of working
  memory and new memory will have been interchanged<EMDASH/>new pairs will be
  constructed in the new memory, beginning at the place indicated by
  <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE>, and the (previous) working memory will be available as the
  new memory for the next garbage collection.
  Figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:memory-reconfig"/> shows the arrangement of memory just
  before and just after garbage collection.

  The state of the garbage-collection process is controlled by
  maintaining two pointers: <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>scan</SCHEMEINLINE>.  These are
  initialized to point to the beginning of the new memory.  The
  algorithm begins by relocating the pair pointed at by <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> to
  the beginning of the new memory.  The pair is copied, the <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE>
  pointer is adjusted to point to the new location, and the <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE>
  pointer is incremented.  In addition, the old location of the pair is
  marked to show that its contents have been moved.  This marking is
  done as follows: In the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> position, we place a special tag
  that signals that this is an already-moved object.  (Such an object is
  traditionally called a 
  <INDEX>broken heart</INDEX>
  <EM>broken heart</EM>.)<FOOTNOTE>The term <EM>
      <INDEX>Cressey, David</INDEX>
      broken heart</EM> was coined by David Cressey, who wrote a garbage
    collector for

    1970s.</FOOTNOTE>
  In the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> position we place a 
  <INDEX>forwarding address</INDEX>
  <EM>forwarding
    address</EM> that points at the location to which the object has been
  moved.

      <TEXT>
  After relocating the root, the garbage collector enters its basic
  cycle.  At each step in the algorithm, the <SCHEMEINLINE>scan</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer
  (initially pointing at the relocated root) points at a pair that has
  been moved to the new memory but whose <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> and <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  pointers still refer to objects in the old memory.  These objects are
  each relocated, and the <SCHEMEINLINE>scan</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer is incremented.  To
  relocate an object (for example, the object indicated by the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  pointer of the pair we are scanning) we check to see if the object has
  already been moved (as indicated by the presence of a broken-heart tag
  in the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> position of the object).  If the object has not
  already been moved, we copy it to the place indicated by <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE>,
  update <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE>, set up a broken heart at the object<APOS/>s old location,
  and update the pointer to the object (in this
  example, the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> pointer of the pair we are scanning) to point
  to the new location.  If the object has already been moved, its
  forwarding address (found in the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> position of the broken
  heart) is substituted for the pointer in the pair being scanned.
  Eventually, all accessible objects will have been moved and scanned,
  at which point the <SCHEMEINLINE>scan</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer will overtake the <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE>
  pointer and the process will terminate.
      </TEXT>
      
      <TEXT>
  We can specify the stop-and-copy algorithm as a sequence of
  instructions for a register
  machine.  The basic step of relocating an object is accomplished by a
  subroutine called <SCHEMEINLINE>relocate-old-result-in-new</SCHEMEINLINE>.  This
  subroutine gets its argument, a pointer to the object to be relocated,
  from a register named 
  <!-- \indcodeplus{old}{register}-->
  <SCHEMEINLINE>old</SCHEMEINLINE>.  It relocates the designated object
  (incrementing <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE> in the process),
  puts a pointer to the relocated object into a register called 
  <!-- \indcodeplus{new}{register}-->
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEMEINLINE>new</SCHEMEINLINE><JAVASCRIPT>new</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, and returns by branching to the entry point stored in the register
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEMEINLINE>relocate-continue</SCHEMEINLINE><JAVASCRIPT>relocate-continue</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.
  To begin garbage collection, we invoke this
  subroutine to relocate the <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer, after initializing <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>scan</SCHEMEINLINE>.  When the relocation of <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> has been
  accomplished, we install the new pointer as the new <SCHEMEINLINE>root</SCHEMEINLINE> and
  enter the main loop of the garbage collector.

  In the main loop of the garbage collector we must determine whether
  there are any more objects to be scanned.  We do this by testing
  whether the <SCHEMEINLINE>scan</SCHEMEINLINE> pointer is coincident with the <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE>
  pointer.  If the pointers are equal, then all accessible objects have
  been relocated, and we branch to <SCHEMEINLINE>gc-flip</SCHEMEINLINE>, which cleans things up
  so that we can continue the interrupted computation.  If there are
  still pairs to be scanned, we call the relocate subroutine to relocate
  the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> of the next pair (by placing the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> pointer in <SCHEMEINLINE>old</SCHEMEINLINE>).  The <SCHEMEINLINE>relocate-continue</SCHEMEINLINE> register is set up so that the

  The subroutine <SCHEMEINLINE>relocate-old-result-in-new</SCHEMEINLINE> relocates objects as
  follows: If the object to be relocated (pointed at by <SCHEMEINLINE>old</SCHEMEINLINE>) is
  not a pair, then we return the same pointer to the object unchanged
  (in <SCHEMEINLINE>new</SCHEMEINLINE>).  (For example, we may be scanning a pair whose <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> is the number 4.  If we represent the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> by <SCHEMEINLINE>n4</SCHEMEINLINE>, as
  described in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:impl-list-ops"/>, then we want the
  <QUOTE>relocated</QUOTE> <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> pointer to still be <SCHEMEINLINE>n4</SCHEMEINLINE>.)  Otherwise, we
  must perform the relocation.  If the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> position of the pair to
  be relocated contains a broken-heart tag, then the pair has in fact
  already been moved, so we retrieve the forwarding address (from the
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> position of the broken heart) and return this in <SCHEMEINLINE>new</SCHEMEINLINE>.
  If the pointer in <SCHEMEINLINE>old</SCHEMEINLINE> points at a yet-unmoved pair, then we move
  the pair to the first free cell in new memory (pointed at by <SCHEMEINLINE>free</SCHEMEINLINE>) and set up the broken heart by storing a broken-heart tag and
  forwarding address at the old location.
  <SCHEMEINLINE>Relocate-old-result-in-new</SCHEMEINLINE> uses a register 
  <!-- \indcodeplus{oldcr}{register}-->
  <SCHEMEINLINE>oldcr</SCHEMEINLINE>
  to hold the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> or the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> of the object pointed at by
  <SCHEMEINLINE>old</SCHEMEINLINE>.<FOOTNOTE>The garbage collector uses the low-level predicate
    <SCHEMEINLINE>pointer-to-pair?</SCHEMEINLINE> instead of the list-structure <SCHEMEINLINE>pair?</SCHEMEINLINE>
    operation because in a real system there might be various things
    that are treated as pairs for garbage-collection purposes.
    For example, in a Scheme system that conforms to the IEEE standard
    a
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    object may be implemented as a special kind of <QUOTE>pair</QUOTE>
