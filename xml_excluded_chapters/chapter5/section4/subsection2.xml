      <TEXT>
  The portion of the explicit-control evaluator at <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence</SCHEMEINLINE> is
  analogous to the metacircular evaluator<APOS/>s <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-sequence</SCHEMEINLINE>
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  It
  handles sequences of expressions in
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  bodies or in explicit
  <SCHEMEINLINE>begin</SCHEMEINLINE> expressions.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
  Explicit <SCHEMEINLINE>begin</SCHEMEINLINE> expressions are evaluated by placing the sequence
  of expressions to be evaluated in <SCHEMEINLINE>unev</SCHEMEINLINE>, saving <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> on the
  stack, and jumping to <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence</SCHEMEINLINE>.
  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>
      <!--  \indcode*{ev-begin} -->
      ev-begin
      (assign unev (op begin-actions) (reg exp))
      (save continue)
      (goto (label ev-sequence))
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
  The implicit sequences in
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  bodies are handled by jumping to
  <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence</SCHEMEINLINE> from <SCHEMEINLINE>compound-apply</SCHEMEINLINE>, at which point <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> is already on the stack, having been saved at
  <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-application</SCHEMEINLINE>.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
  The entries at <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence</SCHEMEINLINE>
  and <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence-continue</SCHEMEINLINE> form a loop that
  successively evaluates each expression in a sequence.  The list of
  unevaluated expressions is kept in <SCHEMEINLINE>unev</SCHEMEINLINE>.  Before evaluating each
  expression, we check to see if there are additional expressions to be
  evaluated in the sequence.  If so, we save the rest of the unevaluated
  expressions (held in <SCHEMEINLINE>unev</SCHEMEINLINE>) and the environment in which these
  must be evaluated (held in <SCHEMEINLINE>env</SCHEMEINLINE>) and call <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-dispatch</SCHEMEINLINE> to
  evaluate the expression.  The two saved registers are restored upon
  the return from this evaluation, at <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence-continue</SCHEMEINLINE>.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
  The final expression in the sequence is handled differently, at the
  entry point <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence-last-exp</SCHEMEINLINE>.  Since there are no more
  expressions to be evaluated after this one, we need not save <SCHEMEINLINE>unev</SCHEMEINLINE> or <SCHEMEINLINE>env</SCHEMEINLINE> before going to <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-dispatch</SCHEMEINLINE>.  The value of
  the whole sequence is the value of the last expression, so after the
  evaluation of the last expression there is nothing left to do except
  continue at the entry point currently held on the stack (which was saved
  by <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-application</SCHEMEINLINE> or <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-begin</SCHEMEINLINE>.)
  Rather than setting up <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> to arrange for <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-dispatch</SCHEMEINLINE> to return here and then restoring <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> from
  the stack and continuing at that entry point, we restore <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> from
  the stack before going to <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-dispatch</SCHEMEINLINE>, so that <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-dispatch</SCHEMEINLINE> will continue at that entry point after evaluating the
  expression.

  In chapter<SPACE/>1 we said that the process described by a
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  such as

  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>
      (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
      (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
            x)))
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  is an iterative process.  Even though the
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  is syntactically
  recursive (defined in terms of itself), it is not logically necessary
  for an evaluator to save information in passing from one call to <SCHEMEINLINE>sqrt-iter</SCHEMEINLINE> to the next.<FOOTNOTE>We saw in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:designing-register-machines"/> how to implement such a
    process with a register machine that had no stack; the state of the
    process was stored in a fixed set of registers.</FOOTNOTE> An evaluator that can
  execute a
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  such as <SCHEMEINLINE>sqrt-iter</SCHEMEINLINE> without requiring
  increasing storage as the
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  continues to call itself is called

  The metacircular implementation of
  the evaluator in chapter<SPACE/>4 does not specify whether the evaluator is
  tail-recursive, because that evaluator inherits its mechanism for
  saving state from the underlying Scheme.  With the explicit-control
  evaluator, however, we can trace through the evaluation process to see
  when
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  calls cause a net accumulation of information on the
  stack.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
  Our evaluator is tail-recursive, because in order to evaluate the final
  expression of a sequence we transfer directly to <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-dispatch</SCHEMEINLINE> without
  saving any information on the stack.  Hence, evaluating the final expression
  in a sequence<EMDASH/>even if it is a
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  call (as in <SCHEMEINLINE>sqrt-iter</SCHEMEINLINE>, where
  the <SCHEMEINLINE>if</SCHEMEINLINE> expression, which is the last expression in the
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  body,
  reduces to a call to <SCHEMEINLINE>sqrt-iter</SCHEMEINLINE>)<EMDASH/>will not cause any information to be
  accumulated on the stack.<FOOTNOTE>This implementation of tail recursion in
    <SCHEMEINLINE>ev-sequence</SCHEMEINLINE> is one variety of a well-known optimization technique used
    by many compilers.  In compiling a
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    that ends with a
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    call,
    one can replace the call by a jump to the called
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE><APOS/>s entry point.
    Building this strategy into the interpreter, as we have done in this section,
    provides the optimization uniformly throughout the language.</FOOTNOTE>

      <TEXT>
  If we did not think to take advantage of the fact that it was
  unnecessary to save information in this case, we might have
  implemented <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-sequence</SCHEMEINLINE> by treating all the expressions in a
  sequence in the same way<EMDASH/>saving the registers, evaluating the expression,
  returning to restore the registers, and repeating this until all the
  expressions have been evaluated:<FOOTNOTE>We can define <SCHEMEINLINE>no-more-exps?</SCHEMEINLINE> as follows:
    <SNIPPET>
      <SCHEME>
        <!--  \indcode*{no-more-exps?} -->
        (define (no-more-exps? seq) (null? seq))
      </SCHEME>
    </SNIPPET>
  </FOOTNOTE>

  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>
      <!--  \indcode*{ev-sequence}[without tail recursion] -->
      ev-sequence
      (test (op no-more-exps?) (reg unev))
      (branch (label ev-sequence-end))
      (assign exp (op first-exp) (reg unev))
      (save unev)
      (save env)
      (assign continue (label ev-sequence-continue))
      (goto (label eval-dispatch))
      ev-sequence-continue
      (restore env)
      (restore unev)
      (assign unev (op rest-exps) (reg unev))
      (goto (label ev-sequence))
      ev-sequence-end
      (restore continue)
      (goto (reg continue))
    </SCHEME>

  This may seem like a minor change to our previous code for evaluation
  of a sequence:  The only difference is that we go through the
  save-restore cycle for the last expression in a sequence as well as
  for the
  others.  The interpreter will still give the same value for
  any expression.  But this change is fatal to the tail-recursive
  implementation, because we must now return after evaluating the final
  expression in a sequence in order to undo the (useless) register
  saves.  These extra saves will accumulate during a nest of
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  calls.  Consequently, processes such as <SCHEMEINLINE>sqrt-iter</SCHEMEINLINE> will require
  space proportional to the number of iterations rather than requiring
  constant space.  This difference can be significant.  For example,
  <INDEX>iterative process<SUBINDEX>implemented by
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      call</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  with tail recursion, an infinite loop can be expressed using only the
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>-call mechanism:

  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>
      (define (count n)
      (newline)
      (display n)
      (count (+ n 1)))
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  Without tail recursion, such a
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  would eventually run out of
  stack space, and expressing a true iteration would require some
  control mechanism other than
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  call.
